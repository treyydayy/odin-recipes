<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dried chile peppers: The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo chile peppers, chile de arbol peppers, and ancho chiles. For a bit of extra heat, don't remove all the seeds.</li>
        <li>Beef: Beef chuck roast is perfect for braising for hours. When you're done, the meat will shred incredibly easily.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: You'll need salt, pepper, fresh garlic, whole cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.</li>
        <li>Olive oil: Sear the meat in olive oil before you add the braising liquid.</li>
        <li>Tomatoes: Grill Roma tomatoes before blending them with other ingredients to unlock extra layers of flavor.</li>
        <li>Vinegar: Two tablespoons of white vinegar adds even more acidity to the braising liquid.</li>
        <li>Tortillas: Use store-bought or homemade corn tortillas</li>
        <li>Onion and cilantro: Finish each taco with chopped onion and fresh cilantro for a final punch of flavor and texture.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the dried peppers for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let the peppers soak until the water is cool. Drain, reserving some water.</li>
        <li>Season the beef and sear on all sides in oil in a Dutch oven.</li>
        <li>Grill the tomatoes until the skin is blistered and begins to peel.</li>
        <li>Blend the soaked chili peppers with the reserved chile water, tomatoes, vinegar, and seasonings.</li>>
        <li>Strain the sauce and pour over the meat. Cover the Dutch oven and cook until the meat begins to fall apart, basting often. Allow the meat to rest, then shred.</li>
        <li>Warm the tortillas on the griddle. Fill each tortilla with meat, onions, and cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
