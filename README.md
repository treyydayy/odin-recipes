This project was created by using the Guidelines of the Odin Project.
In this project by using just basic html. I was able to create recipes pages, that you can use to create some amazing recipes. 
You will see on the main page links that where created using anchor tags that you can access, a 3 different recipes.
Each page is set up using semantic html.
